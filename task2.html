        <div class="grid-item">

        <div class="grid-item">
            <strong>Why is fr better than px for layouts?</strong><br>
            fr is better than px because it distributes available space proportionally and adapts to screen size, making layouts flexible and responsive, while px is fixed and does not adjust to different screen widths.
