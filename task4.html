            <br>In grid rows, auto means the row height adjusts automatically to fit the content inside it, growing or shrinking based on what is placed in that row.

            <strong>What happens if content is very large?</strong><br>
            If the content is very large, the auto row expands to fit all the content, making that row taller and pushing other rows down.
