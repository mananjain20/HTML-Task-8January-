            <strong>Which layout breaks faster on small screens?</strong>
            <br>Layouts made with fixed units like px break faster on small screens, because they do not adjust to screen size, unlike flexible units like fr, %, or auto.
        </div>

        <div class="grid-item">
            <strong>Which layout adjusts automatically?</strong><br>
            The flexible layout that uses fr adjusts automatically according to the screen size.
        </div>

        <div class="grid-item">
            <strong>Why is fixed layout risky?</strong><br>
            A fixed layout is risky because it does not adapt to different screen sizes, so on small screens it can overflow, break alignment, and cause horizontal scrolling, making the design unusable on mobiles and tablets.
        </div>

        <div class="grid-item">
            <strong>Where can fixed columns be useful?</strong><br>
            Fixed columns could be used as sidebars or for adding advertisements to the side of web pages.
        </div>

        <div class="grid-item">
            <strong>Which unit would you choose for a responsive website?</strong><br>
            fr is the unit to use for a responsive website as it adjusts to the screen size.
