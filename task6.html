            <strong>What are grid lines?</strong>
            <br>Grid lines are the invisible horizontal and vertical lines that divide a grid into rows and columns. They are used to position and align grid items inside the grid layout.
        </div>

        <div class="grid-item">
            <strong>How many columns does the item span?</strong><br>
           A grid item spans as many columns as you specify using grid-column: start / end. By default, it spans 1 column if nothing is set.
        </div>

        <div class="grid-item">
            <strong>What happens to other items?</strong><br>
           Other items shift automatically to the next available grid cells. They do not overlap unless you explicitly position them to do so.
        </div>

        <div class="grid-item">
            <strong>Can two items overlap?</strong><br>
            By default, grid items cannot overlap, unless specifically forced to.
        </div>

            <strong>Where is column spanning used in websites?</strong><br>
           Column spanning is used on websites to make elements stretch across multiple columns—for example, a header, banner, or featured section that spans the full width while other content stays in smaller columns.
