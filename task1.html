            <strong>What is the difference between a normal div and a grid container?</strong>
            <br> 
             Div is Just a simple block element. No layout system by default. You manually control position using margin, padding, float, etc. where as Grid A div that becomes a layout manager. It arranges child elements into rows and columns automatically.

        </div>

        <div class="grid-item">
            <strong>Why does the layout look the same even after applying Grid?</strong><br>
            Grid is applied, but no grid structure is defined, so layout stays same.
        </div>

        <div class="grid-item">
            <strong>Are grid items created automatically?</strong><br>
            yes grid items are created automatically. When you apply display: grid to a container, all its direct child elements automatically become grid items without needing any extra class or property. You only control their position using grid rules, not their creation.

        <div class="grid-item">
            <strong>Can Grid work without rows or columns?</strong><br>
            Yes, Grid works without defining rows or columns, but the browser auto-creates a simple single-column layout, so it looks normal.
        </div>

        <div class="grid-item">
            <strong>What do you think Grid needs to show visible changes?</strong><br>
            Grid needs defined properties like rows and columns or the gap between them to visbily
            look like a grid.
